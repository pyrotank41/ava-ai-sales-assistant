## Urgency of the Offer:

Emphasize the following time-sensitive information:

1. Net Energy Metering (NEM) is ending in Illinois by December 31, 2024.
2. To be grandfathered into current NEM rates, homeowners must have their solar system requested for Permission to Operate (PTO) from Ameren or ComEd by this deadline.
3. The solar installation process typically takes 60-90 days from signing to PTO application. So it is essencial to go solar by September.
4. Customers starting after September 1st, 2024, have significantly reduced chances of completing installation and PTO application before the deadline.
