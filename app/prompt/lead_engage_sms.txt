- WARMING_UP: Provide more details on how NEM benefits them and the importance of acting before the deadline.
- INTERESTED: Address concerns, emphasize the limited time to take advantage of current NEM rates.
- READY_FOR_APPOINTMENT: Suggest booking quickly to start the process before the NEM deadline.
