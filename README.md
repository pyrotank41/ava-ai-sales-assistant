# AVA (Artificial Virtual Assistant) Tech Spec

## Overview
AVA is an AI-powered virtual assistant that interacts with customers' clients, conducts sales conversations, pre-qualifies leads, and books appointments. It operates through WhatsApp, Gradio, and CRM platforms like GoHighLevel.
this project is not for multiple customers, but just one. so for more customers, we create different deployments

## Tech Stack
- Backend: Python 3.11+
- Database: SQLite (for simplicity and minimal storage)
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions
- LLM Provider: Azure OpenAI (with periodic evaluations using PromptFoo)
- Vector DB: Qdrant
- Cloud Provider: Azure (current, but flexible)
- Infrastructure as Code: Pulumi
- Logging: Loguru (Python library)

## Components
1. Core AVA Engine
   - Human level conversational skills. 
   - Access to tools.
     - for pre-qualifications
       - google maps api
     - for appointment booking
       - getting free open slots
       - booking apt on one of the open slots
       - sharing the link to the meeting after booking. 
     - for browsing the web for latest info
    
   - Domain-specific knowledge
     - Objection handling samples pairs.
     - domain-specific information.

2. Integration Modules
   - WhatsApp API integration
   - Gradio interface for R&D
   - CRM API integration (GoHighLevel, etc.)
     - ability to delay responses, to make it more human like
     - configurations seperated from code.

3. LLM Integration
   - Azure OpenAI API 
   - claud sonnet 3.5 

4. Vector Database
   - Qdrant integration for efficient similarity search

5. Testing Framework
   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests
   - End-to-end agent testing with PromptFoo

6. Deployment and Infrastructure
   - Pulumi scripts for Azure resources
   - Docker container for app deployment

7. Logging and Monitoring
   - Loguru for application logging
   - ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for log aggregation and visualization
   - Basic alerting through Kibana

## Key Features
- Multi-channel support (WhatsApp, Gradio, CRM)
- Customizable domain knowledge
- Appointment booking integration
- Scalable to support 1000 users

## Storage Optimization
- Utilize CRM storage for message history where possible
- Implement efficient data pruning and archiving strategies

## Logging and Alerting
- Use Loguru for structured logging
- Implement ELK Stack for log management:
  - Elasticsearch for log storage and search
  - Logstash for log ingestion and processing
  - Kibana for visualization and basic alerting
- Set up critical error alerts via email

## Security Considerations
- Implement secure API authentication
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Regular security audits and updates

## Future Considerations
- Performance optimization for scaling beyond 1000 users
- Integration with additional CRM platforms
- Enhanced analytics and reporting features
